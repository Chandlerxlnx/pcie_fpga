the Jungo-tools is good start to generate drivers for PCIe. More or less a piece of cake, even if you are not a SW- or Firmware-guy.

I used that one here:

There is a how-to video on the right hand side of the page and that video really showed me how to run the tool. The ten minutes that are printed on the testimonial are actually correct (ignoring download and installation-time).
